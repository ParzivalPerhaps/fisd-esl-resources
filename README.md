## Committing to the repo

Make sure all changes have been committed to your fork of the repository and create a pull request with the name of the completed task in it.

All PRs will be reviewed by Hayden and you will receive feedback (don't worry I'm nice).

## AI-Use Policy

Please do not submit code to the repository generated by AI.

There a number of reasons for this;

1. Having to review and give feedback on code you did not write is not an effective use of either of our time
2. You will be held accountable for code you submit to the repo, if it breaks then I need you to be able to explain/fix it
3. You took on this project to improve as software engineers and you will be doing yourself very few favors by outsourcing the critical thought to ChatGPT
4. This is not a huge project, you will be okay I promise.

With that said, you are welcome to use Generative AI to explain concepts, code, or libraries for your further understanding.
